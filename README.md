# PRO: A PROTEIN ONTOLOGY IN OBO FOUNDRY FOR SCALABLE INTEGRATION OF BIOMEDICAL KNOWLEDGE

Biomedical ontologies are critical to the accurate representation and integration of genome-scale data in biomedical and clinical research. The Protein Ontology (PRO)-the reference ontology for protein entities in the OBO (Open Biological and Biomedical Ontologies) Foundry-represents protein families, multiple protein forms (proteoforms) arising from single genes, and protein complexes.
